# Caption-generation-from-image-data
The goal of this project is to utilize the class learnings based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. This project uses both these cornerstones of the world of Machine learning and Neural Networks in order to simulate the real world behaviour of human beings and their ability to accurately describe complex images containing multiple objects or subjects in a manner that is consistnat with english grammar in order to be understandable. The project is essentially broken down in 3 sections which have been explained in detail as following:
